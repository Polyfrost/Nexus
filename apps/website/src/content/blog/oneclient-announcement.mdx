### OneClient is a "client" unlike any other.

For a decade, clients have middle-manned the modding community, stealing mods from smaller developers and providing
 a less customizable and performant experience for you.

### OneClient cuts out the middleman:

- **Single-install** for all your favorite mods
- **1.8.9 and 1.21.X** support
- **A unified mod menu** for configs and HUDs
- A launcher that is **convenient and easy to use**

#### With amazing benefits:

- Uses mods **directly from the mod loader**
- **Add your favorite mods** *with no issue,* and remove the ones you don't like
- **Global mod menu / HUD editor,** *no matter where they come from*
- **Powered by PolyUI,** an incredibly optimized UI framework for Minecraft

## Launching Minecraft

Launch Minecraft directly from the app. OneClient will **automatically update yours mods,** so you don't have to worry about anything.

## The mod menu
OneClient comes with a mod menu that works with all your mods. **Any mod you install from OneClient, Modrinth, CurseForge,
or even manually added mods will show up in the mod menu.**

In addition, the search is insanely powerful, allowing you to **search for any option in any mod,** no matter where it comes from.

**Did we mention it also works with HUDs?** You can easily configure your HUDs from the same menu.

We call it **OneConfig**: a unified mod menu for all your config and HUD needs. Isn't it neat?

It's powered by PolyUI, our incredibly optimized and customizable UI framework for Minecraft which allows us to create
incredibly crisp and modern UIs without sacrificing performance.

### Theming
**Think the mod menu doesn't look enough like Minecraft?** Think you'd like it to be in light mode? *Or maybe even... a
Catppuccin theme...*

The OneClient launcher is also planned to have a theming system after the initial release.

### Native OneConfig HUDs

If a mod supports native OneConfig HUDs, you can either use a typical Minecraft-themed HUD or **a modern-styled HUD design.**

With the help of PolyUI, these HUDs also support **advanced "designer" features,** such as custom fonts, colors, and more.

You can even change the padding and alignment of the inner HUD elements!

## The setup

**Setting up OneClient is as easy as downloading the app,** selecting your favorite mod categories, and clicking "Install."

You can also customize your mod selection.

**Add your own mods via our Modrinth/CurseForge mod manager,** or by simply dragging and dropping them into the app.

## Mods, QoL, and performance

With over **4 years of experience,** we've hand-picked the best mods to include in OneClient.

OneClient can do **anything a client can do:**
- **Performance mods** such as Sodium (for 1.21.x), OptiFine (for 1.8.9), Noxesium, Lithium, Entity Culling, Async Particles,
FerriteCore, C2ME, etc.
- **Content creation mods** such as Flashback/ReplayMod
- **PvP and HUD mods** for crosshairs, potion effects, FPS, and more
- **World hosting** via World Host/E4MC

Because we have **cut out the middleman,** mod incompatibility and performance issues are a thing of the past.

You can install **any mod** from Modrinth, CurseForge, or even manually, and it will work seamlessly with OneClient.

#### Notable features that aren't on other clients:
- **All the SkyBlock mods** you could ever want, on 1.8.9 and **1.21.X**, with the ease of use of an all-in-one mod menu
- **Custom item positions** and sizes, with the **only 1:1 1.7 animations mod** for 1.8.9 and 1.21.X
- **Chat tabs,** chat copy (with screenshot support), and chat heads
- **Stop crashes from closing your game** when something goes wrong

## When can I use OneClient?

Join our [Discord server](/discord) to stay updated on the progress of OneClient. If you are a developer, **please consider
contributing** to the project. We are a community-driven project fighting against huge corporations, and we need your help
to make OneClient a reality.

## So... why replace clients?

**For years, clients have operated on a model** that has been largely unchanged since the early days of Minecraft modding:
**a monolithic, ancient model** that hasn't changed to **adapt to the modern world** of Minecraft modding.

Clients effectively work off **stealing and reimplementing mods from smaller developers,** then monetizing them
with ads and cosmetics, while the original developers are left with nothing.
Not only is this unfair, but these reimplementations are often **of lower quality than the original mods,** leading to
a worse experience for you.

**Developers have fought back** with licenses which prevent clients from stealing their work. When corporations like
**Lunar Client and Feather Client** realized **it was impossible to recode mods** like Sodium or ReplayMod,
they opted to **bypass these licenses** by including mod loaders directly in their clients.

What has resulted is a world where **clients simply do not make sense anymore.** They were designed as a way to avoid
using mod loaders, but now **they come with Fabric and Forge built-in.** Strange.

Clients are not even good at maintaining compatibility with mods, as they often break when a mod updates.

**OneClient is something never before seen in the Minecraft modding community.** We have spent 4 years debating and creating
the foundation for this new model, consulting developers and users like you from both the legacy and modern modding communities.

#### A unifying mod menu for all Minecraft config and HUD needs, a launcher that is convenient and easy to use, and most importantly:
A client powered by the community, for the community. A model that is not only fair to developers
but also provides a better experience for you.

### For developers:
If you're tired of the closed and predatory nature of clients: help us take back the modding community.

### For users:
Experience the best of both worlds: one unified mod GUI with all of your configs and HUDs, all the mods you could ever
want pre-installed, and a great launcher.
