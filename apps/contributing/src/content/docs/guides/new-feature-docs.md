title: Adding docs for new features
description: A guide to writing docs for your new Polyfrost project feature.
---

Use the following guidance to document a new Polyfrost project feature.

## What should be documented

If you are adding a new feature to a Polyfrost project, you must document any new **option**, **configuration**, or **method** that someone building a project with Polyfrost might use.

## How pull requests work

If you have never made a pull request (PR) to a Polyfrost project, you can learn more about [making a larger contribution](/first-time/5-contributions/) and our [PR review and merging process](first-time/6-pr/) in our First-Time contributors section.

Make a pull request to the appropriate file:

- as part of your feature PR, if the source file is in the main Polyfrost repository
- as a separate PR to the docs repo, if the source file is in the documentation repository

Be sure to fill out the PR template for each repo, which will allow you to link an implementation PR to a corresponding docs PR.
