## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Creating a New Issue

If you come across an issue or have a feature request for Nexus, please [search if a related issue has already been reported](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If no relevant issue exists, you can open a new issue using the appropriate [issue form](https://github.com/Polyfrost/Nexus/issues/new/choose).

#### Solving an Issue

To find an issue that interests you, you can browse through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Polyfrost/Nexus/issues) and use the available `labels` to narrow down your search (See [Labels](https://github.com/Polyfrost/Nexus/labels) for more information). As a general rule, if you find an issue you want to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Making Changes

#### Making Changes Locally

The system setup script requires [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation). Make sure you have them installed before proceeding.

To make changes locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Polyfrost/Nexus`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Nexus`
3. For Linux or MacOS users, run: `./.github/scripts/setup.sh`
    - This will install all required dependencies for Nexus to build.
4. For Windows users, run the following command in PowerShell: `.\.github\scripts\setup.ps1`
    - This will install pnpm and any other required dependencies for Nexus to build.
    - Soon, this will be deprecated in favor of a build CLI system.
5. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
6. Prepare the build: `pnpm prep` (This will run all necessary codegen and build required dependencies)

To quickly run only the launcher after `prep`, you can use:

-   `pnpm desktop dev`

    If necessary, react-devtools can be launched using `pnpm react-devtools`.
    However, it must be executed before starting the desktop app for it to connect.

To run the website app:

-   `pnpm website dev`

If you encounter any issues, ensure that you are using the following versions of Rust, Node and Pnpm:

-   Rust version: **1.70+**
-   Node version: **18+**
-   Pnpm version: **8.0+**

After cleaning out your build artifacts using `pnpm clean`, `git clean`, or `cargo clean`, it is necessary to re-run the `setup-system` script.

Make sure to read the [guidelines](https://docs.polyfrost.org/nexus/developers/prerequisites/guidelines) to ensure that your code follows a similar style to ours.

### Pull Request

Once you have finished making your changes, create a pull request (PR) to submit them.

-   Fill out the "Ready for review" template to help reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your PR.
-   If you are addressing an existing issue, don't forget to [link your PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
-   Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so that the branch can be updated for merging.
-   Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. They may ask questions or request additional information.
-   You may be asked to make changes before the PR can be merged, either through [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. For other changes, you can make them in your fork and commit them to your branch.
-   As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
-   If you run into any merge issues, refer to this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
